## Edit commit message

</div>

To edit a commit message (like, for example, when you used one that doesn't reference a valid ticket but your Git
server requires that and so the push got rejected by a commit hook), select the **Git** menu, then the
**Show Git Log** option (or, if you have the Git tool window open or docker, you'll find a **Log** tab there).  In it,
find the commit (most likely the most recent at the top, assuming you noticed your mistake right away!), and
right-click it, then select **Edit Commit Message**.  That's it!  You can push the commit after making the appropriate
change.
