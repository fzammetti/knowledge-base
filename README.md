# knowledge-base

This repository is where I store my accumulated knowledge about various topics, just little things I've picked up here
and there that I'd otherwise forget but would like not to :)

WARNING: THIS IS A DUMPING GROUND!

Meaning: I'm going to put lots of pieces of knowledge here, but some of it is old, outdated, or may even be outright
wrong at this point.  I'll curate as time allows, but it's not really my goal.  My goal is simply to dump little tidbits
here for posterity, primarily for myself.  But, I'm putting it here instead of on my private server (where it's all been
for years) so that it might benefit others... but, if anything here causes your SpaceX rocket to explode because it
wasn't accurate, woe be unto you, not me, 'cause you were warned!

(that said, a given piece of information wouldn't have been of much use to me at the time it was written if it wasn't
right, so in reality, MOST of this should be pretty solid, though a lot of it will certainly be old and probably not
of much value to too many people... but you never know who might benefit, hence why it's here now)
